refactor: Move selling logic from monitor to bot package

Improve architecture by clearly separating monitoring from business operations:

- Extract selling functionality into a dedicated sell.go file in the bot package
- Focus monitor package solely on price tracking and monitoring responsibilities
- Implement business logic including token sales in the bot package
- Create MonitorWorker in bot package that bridges UI, monitoring session, and selling functionality
- Use dependency injection for selling functions to improve testability

This refactoring establishes a cleaner separation of concerns where monitor package
provides monitoring capabilities while bot package handles all business operations.
The new structure makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to extend with
clearer boundaries between components.
